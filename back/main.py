# Run scraper.py to create output.txt
# Embed the additional text so it can be used to fine tune an existing ChatGPT model

'''
To embed additional text to train a ChatGPT model, you can follow these general steps:
Collect Additional Text: Gather the additional text you want to use to fine-tune or
train the ChatGPT model. This text should be relevant to the domain or context you want
the model to perform better in.

Data Preprocessing: Preprocess the additional text data. This might include cleaning the
text, removing irrelevant parts, and formatting it appropriately.

Fine-tuning (Optional): If you have access to the base pre-trained ChatGPT model, you can
fine-tune it on your additional text. Fine-tuning helps the model adapt to your specific
use case. You can use the Hugging Face transformers library for this purpose.

from transformers import GPT2LMHeadModel, GPT2Tokenizer, TextDataset, DataCollatorForLanguageModeling, TrainingArguments, Trainer

# Load the pre-trained model and tokenizer
model_name = "gpt2"  # or any other GPT-2 variant
model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained(model_name)
tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)

# Preprocess and tokenize your additional text data
additional_text = [...]  # Your additional text data
encoded_data = tokenizer(additional_text, return_tensors="pt", padding=True, truncation=True)

# Create a TextDataset and DataCollator
dataset = TextDataset(encoded_data)
data_collator = DataCollatorForLanguageModeling(tokenizer=tokenizer, mlm=False)

# Fine-tuning arguments
training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir="./fine-tuned-model",
    overwrite_output_dir=True,
    num_train_epochs=3,
    per_device_train_batch_size=4,
    save_total_limit=2,
)

# Create a Trainer and start fine-tuning
trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,
    data_collator=data_collator,
    train_dataset=dataset,
)

trainer.train()

Training from Scratch (Optional): If you want to train a model from scratch, you can
use a similar approach as above, but you'll need to create a custom language modeling
architecture and adjust the training parameters accordingly.

Remember that training a language model, especially from scratch, can be resource-
intensive and time-consuming. It's recommended to have a good understanding of deep
learning concepts and access to sufficient computational resources.

Evaluation and Testing: After fine-tuning or training, evaluate the model's performance
on a validation set or conduct user testing to ensure the model generates the desired
responses accurately.

Deployment: Once you're satisfied with the model's performance, you can deploy it for
inference in your applications. Use the transformers library to load the fine-tuned
model and generate responses to user input.

Keep in mind that the success of training or fine-tuning a model greatly depends on the
quality and relevance of the additional text data you provide. It's important to
carefully curate and preprocess this data for optimal results.
